/** @file
  This file declares Device Recovery Module PPI.
  The interface of this PPI does the following:
    - Reports the number of recovery DXE capsules that exist on the associated device(s)
    - Finds the requested firmware binary capsule
    - Loads that capsule into memory
  A device can be either a group of devices, such as a block device, or an individual device.T he
  module determines the internal search order, with capsule number 1 as the highest load priority and
  number N as the lowest priority.
