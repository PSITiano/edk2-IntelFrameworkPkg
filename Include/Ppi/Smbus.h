/**
  Executes an SMBus operation to an SMBus controller.

  @param  PeiServices    A pointer to the system PEI Services Table.
  @param  This           A pointer to the EFI_PEI_SMBUS_PPI instance.
  @param  SlaveAddress   The SMBUS hardware address to which the SMBUS
                         device is preassigned or allocated.
  @param  Command        This command is transmitted by the SMBus host
                         controller to the SMBus slave device and the interpretation is
                         SMBus slave device specific.
  @param  Operation      Signifies which particular SMBus hardware protocol
                         instance that it will use to execute the SMBus transactions.
  @param  PecCheck       Defines if Packet Error Code (PEC) checking is required
                         for this operation.
  @param  Length         Signifies the number of bytes that this operation will do.
  @param  Buffer         Contains the value of data to execute to the SMBus slave device.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The last data that was returned from the access
                                matched the poll exit criteria.
  @retval EFI_CRC_ERROR         The checksum is not correct (PEC is incorrect)
  @retval EFI_TIMEOUT           Timeout expired before the operation was completed.
                                Timeout is determined by the SMBus host controller device.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  The request could not be completed
                                due to a lack of resources.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The request was not completed because
                                a failure reflected in the Host Status Register bit.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER Operation is not defined in EFI_SMBUS_OPERATION.
                                Or Length/Buffer is NULL for operations except for EfiSmbusQuickRead and
                                EfiSmbusQuickWrite. Length is outside the range of valid values.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The SMBus operation or PEC is not supported.
  @retval EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  Buffer is not sufficient for this operation.
