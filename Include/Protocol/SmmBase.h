/** @file
  This file declares SMM Base abstraction protocol.
  This protocol is used to install SMM handlers for support of subsequent SMI/PMI activations. This
  protocol is available on both IA-32 and Itanium based systems.
 
  The EFI_SMM_BASE_PROTOCOL is a set of services that is exported by a processor device. It is
  a required protocol for the platform processor. This protocol can be used in both boot services and
  runtime mode. However, only the following member functions need to exist into runtime:
  - InSmm()
  - Communicate()
  This protocol is responsible for registering the handler services. The order in which the handlers are
  executed is prescribed only with respect to the MakeLast flag in the RegisterCallback()
  service. The driver exports these registration and unregistration services in boot services mode, but
  the registered handlers will execute through the preboot and runtime. The only way to change the
  behavior of a registered driver after ExitBootServices() has been invoked is to use some
  private communication mechanism with the driver to order it to quiesce. This model permits typical
  use cases, such as invoking the handler to enter ACPI mode, where the OS loader would make this
  call before boot services are terminated. On the other hand, handlers for services such as chipset
  workarounds for the century rollover in CMOS should provide commensurate services throughout
  preboot and OS runtime.
