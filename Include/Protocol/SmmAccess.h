/** @file
  This file declares SMM SMRAM Access abstraction protocol which is used to control 
  the visibility of the SMRAM on the platform. The expectation is
  that the north bridge or memory controller would publish this protocol. 
  For example, the Memory Controller Hub (MCH) has the hardware provision for this 
  type of control. Because of the protected, distinguished class of memory for IA-32 
  systems, the expectation is that this protocol would be supported only on IA-32 systems.
