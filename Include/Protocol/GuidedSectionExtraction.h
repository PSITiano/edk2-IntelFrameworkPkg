/** @file
  This file declares GUIDed section extraction protocol.

  This interface provides a means of decoding a GUID defined encapsulation 
  section. There may be multiple different GUIDs associated with the GUIDed
  section extraction protocol. That is, all instances of the GUIDed section
  extraction protocol must have the same interface structure.
