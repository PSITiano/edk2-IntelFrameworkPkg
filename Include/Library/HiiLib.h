/**
  This function allocates pool for an EFI_HII_PACKAGES structure
  with enough space for the variable argument list of package pointers.
  The allocated structure is initialized using NumberOfPackages, Guid, 
  and the variable length argument list of package pointers.

  @param  NumberOfPackages The number of HII packages to prepare.
  @param  Guid Package GUID.

  @return
  The allocated and initialized packages.
